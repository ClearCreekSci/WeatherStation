# Clear Creek Scientific WeatherStation

This project provides the resources you need to obtain parts for and create a home-built bluetooth-enabled weather station which measures air temperature, humidity and barometric pressure. Included software and documentation are licensed under the Creative Commons 1.0 Universal license, allowing you to use and modify your weather station as you please, subject to local laws.

The following resources are provided in the various folders of this project.

* [electronics](https://github.com/ClearCreekSci/WeatherStation/tree/main/electronics)
* [software](https://github.com/ClearCreekSci/WeatherStation/tree/main/software)
* [enclosure](https://github.com/ClearCreekSci/WeatherStation/tree/main/enclosure)

We suggest you start with the electronics link, purchasing the equipment listed in the bill of materials. Once your components have arrived, you should then install and test the software before wiring the electronic components together and creating an enclosure for them. Once assembled, the weather station data can be read using the Clear Creek Scientific Data app on an Android 8 or higher device (link forthcoming).
